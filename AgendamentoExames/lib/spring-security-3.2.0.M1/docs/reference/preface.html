            software applications. As you will discover as you venture through this reference guide,
            we have tried to provide you a useful and highly configurable security system.</p><p>Security is an ever-moving target, and it's important to pursue a comprehensive,
            system-wide approach. In security circles we encourage you to adopt "layers of
            security", so that each layer tries to be as secure as possible in its own right, with
            successive layers providing additional security. The "tighter" the security of each
            layer, the more robust and safe your application will be. At the bottom level you'll
            need to deal with issues such as transport security and system identification, in order
            to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks. Next you'll generally utilise firewalls, perhaps
            with VPNs or IP security to ensure only authorised systems can attempt to connect. In
            corporate environments you may deploy a DMZ to separate public-facing servers from
            backend database and application servers. Your operating system will also play a
            critical part, addressing issues such as running processes as non-privileged users and
            maximising file system security. An operating system will usually also be configured
            with its own firewall. Hopefully somewhere along the way you'll be trying to prevent
            denial of service and brute force attacks against the system. An intrusion detection
            system will also be especially useful for monitoring and responding to attacks, with
            such systems able to take protective action such as blocking offending TCP/IP addresses
            in real-time. Moving to the higher layers, your Java Virtual Machine will hopefully be
            configured to minimize the permissions granted to different Java types, and then your
            application will add its own problem domain-specific security configuration. Spring
            Security makes this latter area - application security - much easier. </p><p>Of course, you will need to properly address all security layers mentioned above,
            together with managerial factors that encompass every layer. A non-exhaustive list of
            such managerial factors would include security bulletin monitoring, patching, personnel
            vetting, audits, change control, engineering management systems, data backup, disaster
            recovery, performance benchmarking, load monitoring, centralised logging, incident
            response procedures etc.</p><p>With Spring Security being focused on helping you with the enterprise application
            security layer, you will find that there are as many different requirements as there are
            business problem domains. A banking application has different needs from an ecommerce
            application. An ecommerce application has different needs from a corporate sales force
            automation tool. These custom requirements make application security interesting,
            challenging and rewarding. </p><p>Please read <a class="xref" href="getting-started.html" title="Part&nbsp;I.&nbsp;Getting Started">Part&nbsp;I, &#8220;Getting Started&#8221;</a>, in its entirety to begin with. This
            will introduce you to the framework and the namespace-based configuration system with
            which you can get up and running quite quickly. To get more of an understanding of how
            Spring Security works, and some of the classes you might need to use, you should then
            read <a class="xref" href="overall-architecture.html" title="Part&nbsp;II.&nbsp;Architecture and Implementation">Part&nbsp;II, &#8220;Architecture and Implementation&#8221;</a>. The remaining parts of this guide are
            structured in a more traditional reference style, designed to be read on an as-required
            basis. We'd also recommend that you read up as much as possible on application security
            issues in general. Spring Security is not a panacea which will solve all security
            issues. It is important that the application is designed with security in mind from the
            start. Attempting to retrofit it is not a good idea. In particular, if you are building
            a web application, you should be aware of the many potential vulnerabilities such as
            cross-site scripting, request-forgery and session-hijacking which you should be taking
            into account from the start. The OWASP web site (http://www.owasp.org/) maintains a top
            ten list of web application vulnerabilities as well as a lot of useful reference
            information. </p><p>We hope that you find this reference guide useful, and we welcome your feedback and
